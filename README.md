# Hey there!
Love building things with react and react native. My current focus is working on making [Learn Anything](https://github.com/learn-anything) mobile adaptation.
The code is available in [open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything.xyz/tree/feature/la-135-ios-mobile-app-release-testflight).
I also contribute to the development of [Kuskus](https://github.com/kuskusapp/kuskus), a food-sharing app.
 I enjoy reflecting on my journey and capturing thoughts in [my diary](https://github.com/marshennikovaolga/dear-diary).
 
## Currently studying

GraphQL
