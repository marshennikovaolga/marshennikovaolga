## hey there ðŸª·
Love building things with **react** and **react native**. My current focus is working on making [Learn Anything](https://github.com/learn-anything) mobile adaptation.
The code is available in [open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything.xyz/tree/main/mobile).
Also contribute to the development of [Kuskus](https://github.com/kuskusapp/kuskus), a food-sharing app.
 Enjoy reflecting on my journey and capturing thoughts in [my diary](https://github.com/marshennikovaolga/dear-diary).
